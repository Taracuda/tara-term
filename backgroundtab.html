            <h1>Personal Background</h1>
            <p class="background-text">I was born and grew up in Florence, AL with my parents, sister, and brother. I graduated from high school and received a scholarship to perform
                as a majorette in the marching band at the <a href="https://www.una.edu/" target="_blank">University of North Alabama</a>. I performed in the band for 3 years, then completed my Bachelor Degree in
                nursing. My chosen specialty was adult cardiac care.</p>

            <h1>Beginning of Nursing Career to Now</h1>
            <p class="background-text">I spent 6 years working as a registered nurse, primarily in Birmingham, AL. My specialty remained adult cardiac at my "home hospital", but I worked in medical-surgical
                as well as spinal cord rehabilitation during a year period of time as a travel nurse. During my nursing career, I got married to my husband Robert and we
                settled into our new home. Although I loved many aspects of my nursing career, I eventually came to a point of being so emotionally and physically burned out
                and I made the difficult decision to leave the career I knew and embark on a new path - software development!</p>

            </div>
            <p class="background-text">I took a leap of faith, after lots of reading and research, and applied to the Master of Science in Computer Information Systems program at <a href="https://www.bu.edu/" target="_blank">Boston University</a>. I was
                accepted into the program in 2019, and will be completing my coursework for a Masters in CIS with a concentration in web application development
                in December 2021. I've learned so much since beginning at BU, and I have spent the last year getting hands-on experience as an intern software developer
                for a large manufacturing company here in Birmingham. I will be taking a full-time position as a software developer there in December.</p>
